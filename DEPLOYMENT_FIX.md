# Case Studies Build Error Fix

## Problem

The build was failing on Vercel with the error:

```
Build error occurred
[Error: Failed to collect page data for /case-studies/[slug]] {
  type: 'Error'
}
```

This error typically occurs during the static site generation (SSG) phase when Next.js tries to pre-generate pages using `generateStaticParams()`.

## Root Cause

The error was likely caused by:

1. **Database connectivity issues** during build time
2. **Missing environment variables** in the Vercel deployment environment
3. **Network timeouts** when fetching case studies data
4. **Payload CMS configuration issues** during the build process

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in generateStaticParams()

**File**: `src/app/(frontend)/case-studies/[slug]/page.tsx`

Added try-catch error handling to `generateStaticParams()`:

- Returns empty array on database errors (allows build to continue)
- Pages will be generated on-demand instead of at build time
- Added reasonable limit (1000) to prevent timeout issues

### 2. Improved Error Handling in Page Component

Added try-catch error handling to the main page component:

- Graceful error handling for individual page requests
- Proper 404 responses for missing case studies
- Detailed error logging for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Sitemap Generation

**File**: `src/app/(frontend)/(sitemaps)/case-studies-sitemap.xml/route.ts`

Added error handling to sitemap generation:

- Returns empty sitemap on database errors
- Prevents build failures due to sitemap generation issues

## Vercel Deployment Recommendations

### Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your Vercel project:

```bash
# Required for Payload CMS
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URI=your-database-connection-string

# Required for site URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://your-domain.com
VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL=your-vercel-url.vercel.app

# S3 Storage (if using)
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
S3_REGION=your-region
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Build Settings

In your Vercel project settings:

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Output Directory**: `.next`
3. **Install Command**: `npm install`
4. **Node.js Version**: 18.x or higher

### Database Considerations

1. **Connection Pooling**: Ensure your database can handle multiple concurrent connections during build
2. **Build-time Access**: Your database must be accessible from Vercel's build environment
3. **Timeout Settings**: Consider increasing database timeout settings for complex queries

### Performance Optimizations

1. **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: Pages now use `revalidate = 60` for automatic regeneration
2. **On-demand Generation**: Failed static generation falls back to on-demand generation
3. **Caching**: Sitemaps and data are properly cached

## Testing the Fix

The build now includes robust error handling and should:

1. ✅ Complete successfully even if database is temporarily unavailable
2. ✅ Generate pages on-demand if static generation fails
3. ✅ Provide proper error logging for debugging
4. ✅ Maintain site functionality with graceful degradation

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel with the updated code
2. Monitor Vercel build logs for any database connection issues
3. Set up proper monitoring for case studies pages
4. Consider implementing health checks for your database

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- No changes to the case studies content structure
- Pages will still be statically generated when possible
- Error states are properly handled with user-friendly responses
